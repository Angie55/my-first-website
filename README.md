# My Very First Website

## Welcome!

I have created this simple website while learning how to use the **_Cloud9 IDE_**. 
This was a follow on from learning the basics of **_HTML_** and **_CSS_**. We built it step 
by step with an instructor as a first taster for writing code to create something 
even though the main topics were to learn something else.

What we learnt about and used include:

**1. Command Line** <br>
**2. Git** <br>
**3. Github**

It was a fantastic introduction to things we need to get our head around to be a developer in the real world!
